I will provide a CHUNK OF TEXT and a list of CLASSES.
Which {{max_num_classifications}} classes are relevant to the CHUNK OF TEXT?
For each relevant class, explain in a few words why it is a relevant class.
Return the output in the form:

{
  "classes": [
    {
      "class": "class1",
      "reason": "reason1"
    },
    {
      "class": "class2",
      "reason": "reason2"
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Here is your input data:
CHUNK OF TEXT: {{chunk_string}}
CLASSES: {{classes_list_of_strings}}
